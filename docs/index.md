## Team members

### Lasse Schulz

About:
For almost 8 years, I have been working on private programming projects, which has allowed me to gain experience in the software and hardware fields. My interest in programming was originally sparked by projects at school, which gave me my first insight into the field. I am motivated to further deepen my knowledge in the future, whether through my studies, privately, or in my future career.

### Furkan Dinc

About:
Hello! I am currently a student of business informatics and have a rather unusual background: before my studies, I had only limited contact with computer science. I gained my first experience during my training, where I formulated simple database queries and created a basic HTML page, among other things.

I don't see myself as a classic “techie,” but rather as someone who can make complex topics tangible and communicate between different departments, and that's exactly what appeals to me about business informatics.

### David Levi

About:
Ever since I was a toddler, I have been fascinated by computers and technology. I was convinced early on that I would one day work in this industry. In general, computers and everything related to them are my great passion. I simply enjoy working with them, tinkering with them, and learning new things.

I had my first encounters with computer science at an early age, and since then I have repeatedly worked on small projects in my spare time. Whether software or hardware, I find both areas exciting and have gained practical experience over the years.
