## Codemap

[Describe how your app is structured. Don't aim for completeness, rather describe *just* the most important parts.]

## Cross-cutting concerns

[Describe anything that is important for a solid understanding of your codebase. Most likely, you want to explain the behavior of (parts of) your application. In this section, you may also link to important [design decisions](../design-decisions.md).]
