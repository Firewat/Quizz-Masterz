## 01: Web Application Framework Selection - Flask with Jinja2

### Meta
**Status**: Decided  
**Updated**: 20-06-2025

### Problem Statement
We needed to choose a web application framework that would allow us to:
- Create an interactive quiz platform
- Handle user authentication and sessions
- Manage database operations efficiently
- Support template-based rendering
- Maintain easy testability and deployment
- Enable rapid development with a small team

### Decision
We have decided to use Flask as our web framework with Jinja2 templating engine, SQLite database, and Python backend. This decision was made based on the following requirements:
- Need for a lightweight yet powerful web framework
- Simple integration with SQLite for data persistence
- Built-in template engine for dynamic HTML rendering
- Strong Python ecosystem for educational applications
- Easy learning curve for team members


## 02: Database Architecture - SQLite with SQLAlchemy

### Meta
**Status**: Decided  
**Updated**: 20-06-2025

### Problem Statement
For the quiz platform, we needed a database structure that:
- Manages user profiles and authentication
- Stores quiz content and results
- Enables classroom management
- Supports shop system and points management
- Is easy to maintain and scale

### Decision
We chose SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM, with the following structure:
- Normalized database structure with foreign key relationships
- Efficient indexing of frequently queried fields
- Cascading deletion for dependent records
- Transaction integrity for critical operations

### Rationale
- Perfect for medium-sized applications
- Easy integration with Flask
- No separate database installation required
- Robust ORM functionality through SQLAlchemy
- Simple backup and migration

## 03: Frontend Architecture - Bootstrap with Jinja2

### Meta
**Status**: Decided  
**Updated**: 20-06-2025

### Problem Statement
The user interface needed to:
- Be responsive and user-friendly
- Provide consistent design
- Enable dynamic quiz interactions
- Ensure easy navigation
- Support gamification elements

### Decision
Implementation of a frontend architecture based on:
- Bootstrap for responsive design
- Jinja2 templates for dynamic HTML generation
- AJAX for real-time updates
- Client-side validation
- Modular CSS system for various components

### Rationale
- Bootstrap provides a mature grid system
- Jinja2 enables efficient template inheritance
- Easy integration of gamification elements
- Optimized user interaction through AJAX
- Good browser compatibility
