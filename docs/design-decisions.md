## 01: Frontend Framework Selection - React vs. Vue.js

### Meta
**Status**: Decided  
**Updated**: 20-Jun-2025

### Problem Statement
We need to choose a frontend framework for our quiz application that will allow us to:
- Create interactive quiz interfaces
- Manage complex state for quiz progression
- Handle real-time updates
- Ensure good performance with multiple concurrent users
- Maintain easy testability

### Decision
We have decided to use React as our frontend framework. This decision was made by the core development team considering our collective experience and the project's requirements. React's component-based architecture and extensive ecosystem will help us build a scalable quiz platform more efficiently.

### Regarded Options
We considered two main options:

**React vs Vue.js Comparison:**

Criterion | React | Vue.js
----------|--------|--------
Learning Curve | ✔️ Team already familiar | ❌ Would require additional training
Community Support | ✔️ Large community & resources | ✔️ Growing community
Performance | ✔️ Virtual DOM, efficient updates | ✔️ Similar performance
State Management | ✔️ Redux ecosystem available | ✔️ Vuex available
Testing Tools | ✔️ Jest & React Testing Library | ❌ Less mature testing ecosystem
Mobile Development | ✔️ React Native available | ❌ Limited mobile options
Team Expertise | ✔️ 3 developers with React experience | ❌ No Vue.js experience

The decision for React was based on:
1. Existing team expertise
2. Strong testing capabilities
3. Potential for mobile expansion
4. Large ecosystem of quiz-related components
