We asked multiple Students at the HWR what they thought about our idea and showed them our web application. Most of the students gave us positive feedback and said that the app would be a great way for younger students to learn in school. They all mentioned the motivating effect of earning learning points and unlocking avatars. Several students mentioned that the interface was easy to navigate and visually appealing, making it enjoyable to use.

She also noted that the clear layout made it easy to create and assign quizzes.
