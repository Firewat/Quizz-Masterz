### Lessons Learned & Improvements for Next Time

1. **Skill Development:**
   - We want to further develop our technical and communication skills, for example through pair programming, focused code reviews, and sharing best practices within the team.

2. **More Time for Design & Planning:**
   - Next time, we will consciously allocate more time for the design and planning phase to avoid detours and misunderstandings later on.
   - Early alignment on architecture, data model, and user experience to create a shared understanding from the start.

3. **Creativity & Feasibility:**
   - We want to bring in even more creative ideas, but focus more on what is realistically achievable.
   
4. **Documentation & Reflection:**
   - We want to be even more consistent and continuous in our project documentation and team reflection, to learn better from both mistakes and successes.

**Conclusion:**
We are convinced that with these improvements, we can work not only more efficiently, but also more creatively and sustainably as a team.
