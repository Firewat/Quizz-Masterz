### Goals achieved

**Shop Implementation**
We successfully implemented the shop feature, allowing users to purchase items and customize their profiles. This added a fun and motivational aspect to our platform. The technical integration with the points system worked smoothly, and the shop became a big part for our project.

**Reflection:**
The shop was a challenging but fun and important feature. We learned a lot about frontend-backend integration. Next time, we would like to add even more items and maybe even more features.-

### Goals missed

**Quiz History**
Unfortunately, we did not manage to implement the quiz history feature. Our goal was to allow users to view their past quiz results and track their progress over time. Due to time constraints and technical difficulties, this feature remains unfinished.

**Reflection and Presentation:**
Not properly managing this goal showed us the importance of early planning and prioritization. For future projects, we want to break down big features into smaller steps and start with the most important user stories first. We still see quiz history as a valuable addition and would like to implement it in the future.
