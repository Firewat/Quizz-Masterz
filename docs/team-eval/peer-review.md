## Furkan Ali Dinc - review 1

### My observation 

I got along very well with my team and always felt welcome. The team spirit was great and I enjoyed working together. However, I noticed that my skill level was not as high as that of the others, which sometimes made me feel a bit insecure or hesitant to contribute technically. Despite this, my teammates were always supportive and open.

### Effect on me 

This had a very positive effect on my motivation and made me want to learn more and improve. The supportive atmosphere helped me to ask questions and try new things, even if I was unsure at first. I felt encouraged to grow and be part of the team, regardless of my current skill level.

### Tip for the future 

In the future, I want to keep asking questions and learning from my teammates. I will try to contribute more actively, even if I am not sure about my technical skills yet. I hope to close the skill gap step by step and continue to enjoy working in such a positive and motivating team environment.

## Lasse Schulz - review 2

### My observation 

I always tried to bring good vibes and energy to our group. I liked jumping into discussions and throwing out ideas, even if they sounded a bit wild at first. Helping out with technical stuff and supporting others was something I enjoyed.

### Effect on me 

Because everyone was so open and chill, I felt comfortable just being myself and trying things out. The positive feedback from the team made it easier for me to experiment and not stress about making mistakes.

### Tip for the future 

Next time, I want to keep up the energy and creativity, but maybe also listen a bit more to the quieter people in the group. I think that way, we can get even more cool ideas together. I’ll try to help everyone feel included and keep the team spirit high!

## David Levi - review 3

### My observation 

I usually tried to keep things organized and solve problems step by step. I liked being prepared for meetings and tried to help out when stuff got tricky, especially with the technical parts. Staying calm (even when things got stressful) was important to me.

### Effect on me 

It was really nice to know I could count on the team and that we could talk about any problems without drama. That made me feel safe to ask questions and admit when I didn’t know something.

### Tip for the future

Next time, I want to share what I know even more and maybe help out the others who are still learning. I think if we all help each other out, we’ll get even better as a team. And I want to keep things relaxed and fun, even when the deadlines are close!
